    <h3>Homemade gluten-free waffles made with brown rice flour that are absolutely delicious! They're soft and fluffy on the inside, with crisp, buttery edges</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>102 grams brown rice flour</li>
        <li>30 grams (1/4 cup) tapioca starch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain kefir or buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg room temperature</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>Almond butter jam and maple syrup to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat waffle iron to medium high. In a large bowl, whisk together brown rice flour, tapioca starch, salt, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together vanilla, maple syrup, kefir, and egg until smooth. Whisk these ingredients into the dry, then whisk in the butter until completely combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Then add one third, or half (if you want really large waffles) of the batter to the waffle iron. As the batter sits it will get really thick - not pourable. It's totally okay (you can add a tablespoon of milk to thin it a bit if you'd like). Just spread it out on in the middle of the iron, like you would cake batter.</li>
        <li>Seal, and let cook until just golden brown. (do not overcook) *I don't rely on the timer on my waffle, instead I open lid to look after a few minutes to see how they are coming along. Repeat two more times to makes additional waffles.</li>
        <li>Then top with almond butter, jam, and maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
